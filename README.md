# dependency-inspector
        
A general purpose, mostly universal software packages dependency inspector, using the native dependency resolvers of each package ecosystem.

This project started from a [discussion](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode/pull/2#issuecomment-282987036) on how to store and resolve dependencies for software packages such as Maven, RubyGems, npm, RPMs, etc. in a generalized way.
